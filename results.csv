Add egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about 2 minutes.
, Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1 minute, and shape,into a smooth ball. Since the dough has butter in it, it won’t be sticky.
, Return dough ball to a lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes.
, Once dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital scale. Divide amount,by 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough portions.,
, Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch thick. Shape with your hands to make a small,indention in the middle.,
, Transfer to a silpat-lined baking sheet. Cover and let proof until almost doubles in size, 45 to 60 minutes.,

Brioche Col Tuppo (Sicilian Brioche),30 mins,20 mins, 3 hrs,"milk,water ,honey,dry yeast,orange zest,vanilla extract,white sugar,eggs, beaten,unsalted butter,kosher salt,all-purpose flour, as needed"," Combine milk, water and honey in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk in yeast, and let sit for 20 minutes.
, Add orange zest, vanilla, white sugar, eggs, melted butter, salt, and 4 1/2 cups flour. Use the dough hook to knead on low speed until mixture comes together, scraping sides of bowl as necessary.
, Increase speed one setting, and continue to knead until a soft, smooth, very elastic dough forms, 8 to 10 minutes. If dough seems very wet, and won’t pull away from the sides of bowl after about 5 minutes, add a little more flour in as needed. But, be careful not to add too much, or the brioche will be dry.
, Transfer dough to a work surface and shape into a ball. Transfer into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
, Transfer dough back to the work surface, press out air, and shape into a uniform log shape. Cut into 8 equal portions. For best results, use a digital scale to weigh dough, and then divide by 8, to get perfectly sized portions.
, After dividing, take each portion and cut off 15 to 20% of the dough, to use to make the smaller “tuppo” bun on top. For uniform portions, weigh each portion in grams, and then multiply by 0.17. That will be the amount that you should cut off the portion. My portions came out to 140 grams each, and 17% of that was 24 grams, which is the size I used for the “tuppo.""
, Line a baking sheet with a silpat sheet. Roll each of the 8 larger portions into a smooth ball. Place balls seam side down on the prepared baking sheet. Roll the smaller portions into smooth balls, and set on the baking sheet.
, Very lightly flour your index fingers, and use them to make a deep well in the center of each of the larger bun, into which you will place the tuppo. Before placing it, squeeze one end of the tuppo into a pointed shape to make it fit better. For best results, assemble one bun at a time. Lightly press to settle the tuppo into the bottom bun, so that it is attached, with half the tuppo above the surface of the bun, and half tucked inside.
, Once all buns are formed, place baking sheet into a turned-off oven to proof until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Brush buns  gently but thoroughly with egg wash.
, Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to cool for about 5 minutes before transferring buns to a cooling rack to cool completely.

Stir together, and leave at room temperature until very bubbly and doubled in size, about 5 hours.
, Meanwhile, about 2 hours before the levain will be ready, perform the autolyse: Stir the 135g whole wheat flour, 365g bread flour, and 425g water together in a bowl. Let sit for about 2 hours. If levain is ready to use before the autolyse has gone a full 2 hours, proceed with mixing dough anyway.
, Mix the dough: Weigh out 70g levain, and add to the top of the autolyse mixture of flour and water. Sprinkle salt around the edges. With damp hands, pull up and fold dough from edges to the middle, turning the bowl as you fold, until completely mixed. Cover; let rest for 15 minutes. Cover and return the excess levain to the refrigerator to use for a future batch of bread.
, Perform first set of folds: Lift dough with wet hands at the edge and flop to the middle; turn the bowl a few inches and continue to flop and turn until dough begins to resist being pulled to the center. Repeat folds twice more, 15 minutes apart, covering dough in between.

, Turn dough out onto counter, and pre-shape dough into a ball. Dust with flour, and let rest on the counter 30 minutes.
, Perform the final shaping: Dust the counter with flour, and gently flop the dough over into the flour with the bench scraper. Again, perform a stretch and fold, but gently, to not deflate the dough. Shape into as high and round a ball as possible using the bench scraper. Dust the top with flour.
, Generously dust a banneton with rice flour, Carefully slide the bench scraper under the dough, and turn it over into the banneton. Now, and this is optional, ""stitch"" the dough by bringing opposite pieces of the dough up, sticking them together in the center. Dust with a little flour.

, Mix salt, sugar, and orange zest in a small bowl until fully combined. Sprinkle instant cure evenly and lightly all over the skin on all sides, and season the cavity as well. Place turkey on a grate over a sheet tray and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. 
, When ready to begin smoking, remove turkey from refrigerator and bring to room temperature, about 1 hour.
, Preheat a smoker to 300 to 325 degrees F (160 to 165 degrees C).
, Combine smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, sage, mustard, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper in a bowl for the dry rub; stir to mix thoroughly.
, Place turkey on a cutting board and pat dry to remove as much moisture as possible from the meat. Lightly sprinkle rub all over the skin, flip over, and sprinkle onto the cavity. Don’t massage in. Cover the entire surface area, as well as under and around wings. 
, Place turkey in the center of the preheated smoker and close the lid. Watch temperature and adjust airflow if needed to maintain temperature. Set a timer for 45 minutes. The meat has to adjust to the heat and smoke of the grill. The most crucial part of this recipe is this time period.

Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and ingredients are well combined, about 5 minutes. Pour into a bowl to cool and add to a spray bottle for later use.

, Place turkey breast meat side up on a cutting board, and make a deep cut into the thickest part at a 45-degree angle, about 2/3 of the way in, to butterfly open the breast. Make a few more shallow cuts to open up even more, and then coat all exposed meat with about 3/4 of the spice mixture. Be sure to rub spices in thoroughly.
, Fold turkey back together with the skin side up, and use 3 pieces of kitchen string to tie up tightly into a roll. Transfer to a bowl, and coat with 1 tablespoon olive oil and remaining spice mix. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours before roasting.

Cooking time depends on size of breast, so start checking for doneness early. Remove turkey to a plate and cover loosely with foil. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
, Meanwhile, place the roasting pan over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil until liquids have reduced.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, and check the amount of rendered fat in the pan. If necessary add a 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil, so there will be enough fat to make a roux. If there are already a few tablespoons fat from the turkey, you will not need to add any more oil, and can move to the next step.
, Add flour and cook, stirring, for about a minute. Add lemon juice and chicken broth, and turn heat up to medium-high. Stir constantly while mixture comes back to a simmer. Add a little more broth if the sauce is too thick, or continue to simmer if sauce is too thin. Taste for salt and adjust. Reduce heat to low and keep hot until needed.
, Slice turkey, and serve with sauce.
